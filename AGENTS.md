# Helm charts - Contributor guidance

## Code Review Rules

- Review the PR diff for actionable correctness, security, data-loss, and deployment regressions; cite the changed file/line and concrete impact.
- Preserve authentication boundaries, persisted data compatibility, and the project's documented build/test/deploy contracts. Adapt shared patterns to this project's stack.
- Report missing behavioral coverage where it would catch a specific regression; leave formatting and mechanical checks to CI.

## Codex automation

Use native Codex GitHub reviews and `@codex` PR tasks with ChatGPT sign-in.
Setup: https://github.com/mucsi96/skeleton-app/blob/main/docs/codex-automation.md

## Chart compatibility

Read the affected chart's documentation and values before editing templates.
Check upgrades for changes to resource names, persistent volumes, workload
identities, selectors, and values consumed by application deploy scripts.
